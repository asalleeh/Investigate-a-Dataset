Introduction 

Data Wrangling 

Exploratory Data Analysis

Conclusions

Limitations: The data was enough to me but there is some outliers example: 1- the budget of some movies was not accurate example 1 USD!! so I removed all movies where the budget is less than 10000 USD 2- the revenue of some movies was not accurate, so I removed all movies where the revenue is less than 10000 USD 3- Split the keywords and geners column to get an accurate value. The conlusion of my project that: 1- The revenue of action movies is higher than other genres in the history of movies which is preferred investement to pruduction companies. 2- The year 2011 is the most producing year of movies regardless the genre, this is andicator that the production companies have good budget and good economic situation on 2011.
